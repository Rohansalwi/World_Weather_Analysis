# World Weather Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
This project is to utilize Google Maps API to generate a directions map connecting four different places including the place started and ending at the same place.

## Results
Four different hotels in different cities in Mexico are selected and the driving route is displayed. I have also included the weather information of the same.

## Summary
A number of factors can be included in the code making it dynamic. 
1. A user input can be taken to select a country and based on that selection the cities are displayed for user selection.
2. Based on this input the maps are generated.
